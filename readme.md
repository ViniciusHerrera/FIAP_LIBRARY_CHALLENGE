## üß¨ Functional Requirements

Book management: the objective of your system will be to provide an API that has CRUD functionalities so that a Front-end application can manage this data.

Proposed structure for Book entity: each book can have a title, author, ISBN, year of publication and, if you want to venture out, you can add a Publisher Entity, so a book can be part of a Publisher and a Publisher can have a list of books

## üîß Technical Requirements

Project development using the latest version of TypeScript to ensure your code is up to date. System integration with a database that can be NoSQL or SQL. In this scenario, you can use Docker or a free database like PostgreSQL on the Supabase platform.

## üíª Prerequisites

Before you begin, check that you have met the following requirements:

* You have a `Windows` machine.
* You have a `C# runtime environment`;
* You have installed `Visual Studio 2017/2019, .NET framework 4.5, Sap Connector - v3.0.0.42, Newtonsoft.Json - v1.0.0.0, NLog - 5.0.0.0`.
* You have `Itau Bank API credentials`.
* You have read the following documentation:
  * [It√°u - Dynamic Certificate Generation](https://devportal.itau.com.br/certificado-dinamico).
  * [It√°u - mTLS Authentication Production](https://devportal.itau.com.br/autenticacao-documentacao).
  * [It√°u - Api Cash Management](https://devportal.itau.com.br/nossas-apis/itau-ep9-gtw-sispag-ext).


## üöÄ Installing the Project

To seamlessly set up the ItauApiClient, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the debug folder and acquire the `ItauApiClient.exe` along with its dependencies. Place these files in the designated directory on your server.
3. Update the credentials necessary for accessing the Itau API, SAP, and SQL server. Make the required changes in both `NLog.config` and `ItauApiClient.exe.config` files.
4. Ensure that the `certificate.pfx` is available in the Certificates folder along with other dependencies.
5. Some credentials are provided by the Itau contact point. Reach out to them to obtain the required credentials.

## ‚òï Using the Project

To utilize the ItauApiClient, execute the `ItauApiClient.exe`. If you intend to schedule the execution, we recommend utilizing the SQL Server Agent.
